# robot-cli-wrapper
This is a command line wrapper for ROBOT (Open Biomedical Ontolologies) [http://robot.obolibrary.org/] tool.

It can be tedious to run queries using `robot query`, which requires typing in the all file paths each time. This is a simple cli wrapper that will require taking the input paths only once, and subsequently automates the run process.

TO DO:
- Accept input file paths interactively from the user.
